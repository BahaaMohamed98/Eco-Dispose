## Features

- **Frontend:** Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for now.
- **Data Simulation:** JSON files in `frontend/data/` to act as a temporary backend.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional across different screen sizes.
- **Backend:** Planned but not yet implemented.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BahaaMohamed98/E-Waste-Management-System.git
cd E-Waste-Management-System
```

## Future Plans

- Implement a backend (Flask or Node.js/Express).
- Connect frontend with a real database.
- Add authentication and user accounts.
